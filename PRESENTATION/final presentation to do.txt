Defining the problem (introduction) "moving heavy parts in hanger" + Speak about the heavy part come from firefighting plane Seagle. Maybe thanks GaÃ«tan to allow us the oppurtunity to have this project (suce boule p-e) (ask in the matrix)

Solution (designing of over head crane)

some of the main specification

Going through design process (according to the specifications)

challenges faced during this process (have to change preliminary layout) (Maybe size of the beam is a big one (during dimensionning), maybe the paloniers were also "complicated" solution for the 2e rotation)

justify how we managed to solve this and made good choice.

prove the feasibilty of design according to specification

show dimensioning of main parts and they will not fail under max condition

some detail on parts which are available in market and which have to give to manufacturer

present our solution with different views

add animation video if possible => I think it will be difficult

cost estimation

SOME EXTRA NOT MENTION IN EVALUATION MATRIX


sustainabilty and life of the product.

warrenty of the product
