- 1 - Tolerances + surface quality parts to choose :
(1) Shaft
(2) Bearings
(3) Gear

I think that we can choose 4 other pieces from another part of the whole system since they
would like we have 5 drawings but the 3 ones are quite simple :-)
We could say that we design the pulleys ourself ? It is not complicated to find the
pieces
Remarks (if not clear, tell me and we can discuss)

- 2 - General remarks : 

* for the bolts, check on internet on to "dimension" them
--> often M16 or M20 are commonly used but check the load they can support
and thus adapt the number of bolts

* for the rails and the rack on the beam, we need to discuss altogheter (I talked with my
dad to see or it would be more pratical) in order to place the bearings, motoreductor,...

* For the rack and pinion "area", still remains shaft (Youri), bearings (already done ?),
gear

*it is possible that we would need to add stuff like a "block" to link easier parts on
the trolley

- 3 - Remarks on different parts
(1) Drum :
	- need bearings (see the ones in the folder "Palonnier")
	- motor could be done like the one of Aurélien (palonnier) (but see the remark
on that : there should be a "accouplement")
	- how the motor and the drum will be attached on the plateform ?

(2) Palonnier :
	- Very nice !
	- Bolts : how did you dimensioned them ? (M16 or M20 are typical bolts used)
	- Add between the 2 "faces" a part that would make the structure more rigid
	- The 2 "faces" are not fixed to the other pieces --> need bolts or smthg else
	- Motor shaft : needs a key way (the key is just in contact)
	- Motor shaft need a "accouplement" between motor shaft and cylinder (to ensure
that both remain always aligned : there is a "caoutchouc" in the accouplement => flexible)
	- How the motor is "attached" to the "top" ?

(3) Slewing ring :
	- the device that makes rotate the ring is missing
	- be careful to the way the different part are fixes/assembled
	- it is needed to have the motor (even a simple one like Aurélien downloaded)

(4) Rollers :
	- Nearly nothing done (see the Demag pdf with the cross sections and dimensions
check in the report 3 which have been chosen)
